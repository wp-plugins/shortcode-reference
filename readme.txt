This plugin will provide a list and details about available shortcodes in your current installment. All when you need it most.
When editing your content.  


== Description ==

One of the fancy things within Wordpress-plugins, is the availability of shortcodes. 
These codes will provide access to plugin-specific things, like displaying a gallery, or a Google-Map. 
The downside about this, is that there's no generic overview of all available shortcodes within your environment.

This plugin will provide a list of all available shortcodes, right where the action is. When you're editing your content. And it won't skip the details: it'll show you what its origin is. 
Most of all, if it's available in the sourcecode, the documentation will be shown. 

The plugin is largely based on [PHP5's Reflection functionality](http://php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php), and therefore only available from PHP version 5.0.0.
